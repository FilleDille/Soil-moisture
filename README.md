# Soil moisture rig for Raspberry Pi Pico

**Description:** This rig measures the moisture in a pot of soil. This is done by measuring the voltage from an analog capacitative soil sensor to determine the relative level of moisture. The variable voltage_max is calibrated to the voltage when the soil is dry enough to need water and voltage_min is the voltage about an hour after the pot has been watered.

**Components:**
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Seeed Grove Capacitive Moisture Sensor
- TM1637 4-Digit 7-Segment Display
- USB C cable with 5 V power supply
